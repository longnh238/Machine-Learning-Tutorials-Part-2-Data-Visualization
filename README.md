# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 2: Data Visualization

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 2: Data Visualization**, the second part of our beginner-friendly series. This tutorial focuses on data visualization using two of the most popular Python libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn. In this part, you'll learn how to effectively visualize data to gain insights and enhance the communication of your machine learning results.

## Introduction
This tutorial covers the basics of data visualization, focusing on:
- **Matplotlib**: The foundational Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

We aim to build a strong foundation in these libraries so you can use them to explore and analyze datasets more effectively.

## Installation
To run the tutorials, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy (for working with datasets)

## Tutorial Topics
1. **Introduction to Matplotlib**
   - Creating basic plots (line plots, bar plots, scatter plots)
   - Customizing plots (labels, titles, legends, colors)
   - Subplots and layouts
2. **Seaborn for Statistical Visualization**
   - Creating advanced plots (distribution plots, pair plots, heatmaps)
   - Customizing aesthetics with Seaborn styles
   - Visualizing complex data relationships using Seaborn's high-level API
3. **Combining Matplotlib and Seaborn**
   - Enhancing Matplotlib plots with Seaborn's powerful themes
   - Best practices for visualizing machine learning results

## Getting Started
Each tutorial is provided in a separate Jupyter Notebook file. To explore the tutorials, run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal and navigate to the `.ipynb` file for each topic to get started with hands-on examples.
